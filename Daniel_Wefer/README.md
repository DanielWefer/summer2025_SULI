# Daniel Wefer - Weekly Logs

### Week 1

----------------------------------------------
 - completed all mandatory onboarding tasks/training
 - set up the python environment on my lab computer
 - located and downloaded ceilometer data for my project
 - made some basic time-series plots exploring the data
 - researched previous PBLH detection work and possible edge detection algorithms for my project
----------------------------------------------

### Week 2 

----------------------------------------------
 - experimented with extracting and plotting multiple scales of 2d trous wavelet transforms
 - implemented Sobel, Canny, and Lagrangian edge detection algorithms on raw ceilometer data
 - experimented with thresholding and extracting edges from the remaining smoothed image after multiple wavelet scales were extracted
 - toured ATMOS facility
 - attended Eddy Covariance workshop
----------------------------------------------

### Week 3

----------------------------------------------
 - got set up on gce compute
 - implemented vertical and horizontal wavelet transforms and experimented with adding different quantities of each for edge detection
 - implemented OTSU automated thresholding then applied edge detection to the results
 - Tested methods for removing noise
 - created a clean script to run these steps on multiple cases and save the result as a entCDF
 - ran the script on 10 days of ceilometer data
